# TODO-List-Tech-Module
TODO List (in C#, Java, JS and PHP) - Exam Preparation for the Tech Module @ SoftUni (August 2017)

You are assigned to create a **Simple TODO List App**. The application should hold **tasks**, which are the main app entities.
The functionality of the app should support creating, listing, editing and deleting tasks. The application should persist the data into a database.

## Overview
Your application should be built on each one of the following technologies:

### PHP
* **Symfony** framework
* **Twig** view engine
* **Doctrine** ORM
* **MySQL** database

### JavaScript
* **NodeJS** + **ExpressJS** frameworks
* **Handlebars.js** view engine
* **Mongoose** data access
* **MongoDB** database

### Java
* **Spring** framework (Spring MVC + Spring Boot + Spring Data)
* **Thymeleaf** view engine
* **JPA** / **Hibernate** ORM + **Spring Data** data access
* **MySQL** database

### C#
* **ASP.NET** framework (ASP.NET MVC + Entity Framework)
* **Razor** view engine
* **Entity Framework** ORM
* **MSSQL Server** database

## Data Model
The `Task` entity holds 3 properties:
* `id` - technology-dependent identifier (`ObjectID` for JavaScript, `int` for all other technologies)
* `title` - nonempty text
* `comments` - nonempty text

## User Interface
This is the user interface should consists of the following pages (under the designated routes):

### Index Page
Route: `/` (GET)

List all tasks.
 
### Create Page
Route: `/create` (GET and POST)

`GET` shows a form to create a task. `POST` saves the form data into the database as new task.
 
### Delete Page
Route: `/delete/{id}` (GET and POST)

`GET` shows a form to delete a certain task. `POST` confirms deleting a task and removes the task from the database.

### Edit Page
Route: `/edit/{id}` (GET and POST)

`GET` shows a form to edit a certain task. `POST` confirms editing a task and modifies the task in the database.
 
## Languages and Technologies
Implement the **TODO List App** on all mentioned 4 technology stacks.

## Setup
Before you start working, make sure you download all the dependencies (packages) required for each technology and set up the databases! Below are instructions on how to do this:

### PHP and Symfony
1. Go into the root directory of the project (where the bin folder resides)
2. Make sure you’ve started your MySQL server (either from XAMPP or standalone)
3. Open a shell / command prompt / PowerShell window in that directory (shift + right click --> open command window here)
4. Enter the `php composer.phar install` command to restore its **Composer** dependencies (described in `composer.json`)
5. Enter the `php bin/console doctrine:database:create` command
6. Done!

### JavaScript and Node.js
1. Go into the root directory of the project (where the bin folder resides)
2. Make sure you’ve started your MongoDB server: `mongod.exe --dbpath path/to/db/directory`
3. Open a shell / command prompt / PowerShell window in the root directory (shift + right click --> open command window here)
4. Enter the `npm install` command to restore its **Node.js** dependencies (described in `package.json`)
5. Done!

### C# and ASP.NET MVC
The C# project will automatically resolve its **NuGet** dependencies (described in `packages.config`) using the NuGet package restore when the project is built.

### Java and Spring MVC
The Java project will automatically resolve its **Maven** dependencies (described in `pom.xml`) when the project is built.
